## Reporting a Security Issue

I take any security-related matters very seriously. If you discover any security issues with neko-ui, please don't report them on a public issue tracker. Instead, contact me privately.

1. Please send an email to <meow.monako@gmail.com>. Please provide as much detail as possible about the issue you have discovered, including how to reproduce it and the potential impact it may have.
2. I will promptly acknowledge your report and communicate with you for further details if necessary.
3. Once the issue is confirmed, I will work with you to fix it and publicly notify the community in due course.

## Handling of Security Issues

1. Upon receiving your report, I will assess the severity and priority of the problem.
2. Once the issue is confirmed, I will develop a fix and release it in the next version.
3. After the fix is released, I will publicly acknowledge and provide detailed information about the person who reported the issue.
